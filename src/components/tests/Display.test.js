///Tasks:
//1. Add in nessisary imports and values to establish the testing suite.
//2. Test that the Display component renders without any passed in props.
//3. Rebuild or copy a show test data element as used in the previous set of tests.
//4. Test that when the fetch button is pressed, the show component will display. Make sure to account for the api call and change of state in building your test.
//5. Test that when the fetch button is pressed, the amount of select options rendered is equal to the amount of seasons in your test data.
//6. Notice the optional functional prop passed in to the Display component client code. Test that when the fetch button is pressed, this function is called.

These satellites will incorporate features such as data transmission that were not emphasized in the original design. The constellation will provide L-band data speeds of up to 128 kbit/s to mobile terminals, up to 1.5 Mbit/s to Iridium Pilot marine terminals, and high-speed Ka-band service of up to 8 Mbit/s to fixed/transportable terminals. The next-generation terminals and service are expected to be commercially available by the end of 2018. However, Iridium's proposed use of its next-generation satellites has raised concerns the service will harmfully interfere with GPS devices. The satellites will incorporate a secondary payload for Aireon, a space-qualified ADS-B data receiver. This is for use by air traffic control and, via FlightAware, for use by airlines. A tertiary payload on 58 satellites is a marine AIS ship-tracker receiver, for Canadian company exactEarth Ltd. Iridium can also be used to provide a data link to other satellites in space, enabling command and control of other space assets regardless of the position of ground stations and gateways." }, { mission_name: "ABS", mission_id: "2CF444A", manufacturers: ["Boeing"], payload_ids: ["ABS-3A", "ABS-3B"], wikipedia: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABS_(satellite_operator)", website: "http://www.absatellite.com/", twitter: null, description: "ABS, formerly Asia Broadcast Satellite, is a global satellite operator based in Hong Kong and officially incorporated in Bermuda.
